# VISUALIZING-MAJI-NDOGO-WATER-CRISIS
üíß Project Overview: Water Access Analysis in Maji Ndogo
This Power BI project explores the state of water access in the fictional country of Maji Ndogo, using a robust dataset derived from national surveys. The goal is to identify pressing challenges, uncover regional disparities, and propose data-driven recommendations for improving access to safe and reliable water services. Through interactive dashboards and analytical visuals, the report aims to support effective decision-making and guide targeted infrastructure investments.

üîç Dashboard Objectives
The dashboard provides insights into:

The major findings and patterns related to water access across Maji Ndogo

The number of individuals affected by poor access and the nature of these difficulties

Budget estimates required to improve water access infrastructure and how funds should be distributed

Provincial comparisons and access gaps between urban and rural populations

‚öôÔ∏è Workflow Summary
Steps completed in building this dashboard:

Data cleaning and preprocessing

Transformation using Power Query Editor

Development of DAX measures for dynamic calculations

Visualization using interactive Power BI reports

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and insight generation

üìä Key Findings
Only 34% of the population has access to basic water services‚Äîclean, safe, and efficiently accessible.

Roughly 66% of the population continues to face water-related challenges.

The estimated budget needed to resolve these issues is $147 million, with the highest allocations required in Kilimani ($39M) and Sokoto ($40M).

Kilimani (6,700) and Sokoto (5,603) towns require the most infrastructure upgrades, while Amanzi (3,748) requires the least.

The most common issues include broken taps, contaminated wells, and long queues at overcrowded water points.

Rural residents rely mainly on shared taps and wells, while urban areas benefit from in-home water access.

Provincial access levels vary:

Kilimani: 28%

Hawassa: 30%

Sokoto: 31%

Akatsi: 37%

Amanzi: 41%

National average: 34%

üìå Recommendations
Target High-Need Provinces: Invest heavily in Kilimani and Sokoto, which have the lowest access levels and largest populations in need.

Rural Infrastructure Investment: Improve shared sources with new taps and introduce water quality monitoring, especially for rural communities.

Prioritize High-Impact Solutions: Emphasize initiatives like tap repairs and RO filter installations to yield immediate benefits.
